Quick Note is a powerful tool designed to streamline note-taking. You can create a new note in many different waysâ€”using the menubar, global shortcuts, widgets, the main window, the Shortcuts app, Apple Script Editor, or even the Services menu. This flexibility ensures you can quickly capture ideas no matter how you work.

## Menubar
