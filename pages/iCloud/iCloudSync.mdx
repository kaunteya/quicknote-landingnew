# iCloud sync

## Backup
iCloud sync will keep all your notes backed up on your iCloud account associated with your apple id. Once enabled, all your notes and folders are seamlessly synced on the server.

This feature requires active Internet connection. If your Mac is not connected to the internet, then backup resumes only after your Mac is connected back to the Internet.

Your backup will be automatically restored when you set up your new Mac with the same apple id. This feature is helpful if your Mac breaks down or gets stolen.

## Sync across devices
With iCloud sync, you can keep your notes synced across your Macs.
To enable this, make sure you have enabled iCloud sync on all your Macs.
