# Troubleshooting iCloud Sync

- Ensure iCloud sync is enabled in the Quick Note settings on all devices you wish to sync.
- Ensure all devices are online.
- Ensure your iCloud storage is not full.
- Resolve any Apple ID or iCloud errors on your devices (e.g., sign-in prompts).
- Ensure all devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
- Try restarting all devices.
- Ensure Low Power Mode is not enabled on the devices. It can cause iCloud to delay syncing.
- Ensure Quick Note is enabled in “System Settings › Apple ID › iCloud › iCloud Drive › Apps syncing to iCloud Drive”.
- Ensure you are on the latest macOS version and Quick Note version.
- If it’s a work Mac, make sure there are no restrictions in place that prevents iCloud or iCloud Drive.
- If using a VPN, try disconnecting it, as some VPNs can interfere with iCloud syncing.
- Check the [iCloud system status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to ensure the service is not experiencing issues.
